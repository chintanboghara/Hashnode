## What is monolithic architecture?

A monolithic architecture is a traditional software design where the program is built as a single, self-contained unit, separate from other applications. The term "monolith" suggests something large and unchanging, which fits the nature of monolithic software design. It consists of one large computing network with a single code base that combines all business functions. To make changes to this type of application, you must update the entire stack by accessing the code base, then building and deploying a new version of the server-side interface. This process makes updates restrictive and time-consuming.

Monoliths can be convenient early in a project's life because they simplify code management, reduce mental effort, and make deployment easier. This setup allows everything in the monolith to be released at the same time.

### Advantages of a Monolithic Architecture

* Simplifies code management
    
* Reduces mental effort
    
* Eases deployment by allowing simultaneous releases
    

### Disadvantages of a Monolithic Architecture

* Updates are restrictive and time-consuming
    
* Requires updating the entire stack for changes
    

## What are microservices?

A microservices architecture, often called microservices, is a design approach that uses a series of independently deployable services. Each service has its own business logic and database, focusing on a specific goal. Updating, testing, deployment, and scaling happen within each service. Microservices separate major business and domain-specific concerns into distinct, independent code bases. While microservices don't reduce complexity, they make it more visible and manageable by breaking tasks into smaller processes that work independently and contribute to the overall system.

Arrows illustrate interactions between the UI microservice and three components: payment, shopping cart, and inventory.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1735753951919/9c151ece-1ad5-408d-8f1b-a5a315d5c5e1.png align="center")](https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:5308ccab-dc94-46f5-978c-8a77b8d5be57/Microservice%20architecture@2x.png?cdnVersion=2484)

### **Advantages of Microservices**

* Independent updates and scaling
    
* Easier testing and deployment
    
* Focused business logic for each service
    

### **Disadvantages of Microservices**

* Increased complexity in managing multiple services
    
* Requires more coordination between services
    
* Potential for higher resource consumption
    

## When to Use Monolithic vs. Microservices Architecture

Both monolithic and microservices architectures help developers build applications using different approaches. It's important to understand that microservices don't reduce an application's complexity. Instead, they make the complexities more visible, allowing developers to build, manage, and scale large applications more efficiently.

When choosing between a microservices or monolithic architecture, consider the following factors.

### Application Size

The monolithic approach is better for designing a simple application or prototype. Since monolithic applications use a single code base and framework, developers can build the software without needing to integrate multiple services. Microservice applications might require a lot of time and design effort, which may not be worth it for very small projects.

On the other hand, microservices architecture is ideal for building complex systems. It offers a strong programming foundation for your team and allows them to add more features flexibly. For example, Netflix uses AWS Lambda to scale its streaming infrastructure and save development time.

### Team Competency

Even though microservices offer flexibility, developing with them requires a different skill set and design approach. Unlike monolithic applications, working with microservices demands knowledge of cloud architecture, APIs, containerization, and other skills specific to modern cloud applications. Additionally, troubleshooting microservices can be difficult for developers who are new to distributed architecture.

### Infrastructure

A monolithic application runs on a single server, while microservices applications work better in a cloud environment. Although you can run microservices on a single server, developers usually host them with cloud service providers to ensure scalability, fault tolerance, and high availability.

It's important to have the right infrastructure before starting with microservices. Setting up the tools and workflow for microservices requires more effort, but they are more suitable for building complex and scalable applications.
