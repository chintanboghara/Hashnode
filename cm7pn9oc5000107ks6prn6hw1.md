OpenAI is excited to announce **Operator**, a research preview of an innovative agent that can autonomously perform web-based tasks using its very own browser. Designed to work independently by interacting with webpages—typing, clicking, and scrolling—Operator marks a significant leap in how AI can actively participate in your digital ecosystem. Currently available to Pro users in the U.S., this preview is a step toward reshaping everyday digital interactions.

## What is Operator?

Operator is one of OpenAI’s first agents—AI systems that can work for you independently. Whether it’s filling out forms, ordering groceries, or even creating memes, Operator harnesses the power of advanced AI to execute tasks on your behalf using the same interfaces that humans use daily. This approach not only saves you time on repetitive tasks but also opens up exciting opportunities for businesses seeking innovative customer experiences and streamlined workflows.

### Key Highlights:

* **Research Preview:** Operator is currently in a research phase, meaning it comes with some limitations and will evolve based on user feedback.
    
* **Pro User Rollout:** Initially available to Pro users in the U.S. via [operator.chatgpt.com](http://operator.chatgpt.com), with plans to expand to Plus, Team, and Enterprise users and eventually integrate these capabilities into ChatGPT.
    
* **Independent Task Execution:** Give Operator a task and watch as it navigates the web to complete it, using familiar human-like interactions.

## How Operator Works: The Technology Behind the Magic

At the core of Operator is a groundbreaking model known as the **Computer-Using Agent (CUA)**. CUA combines GPT‑4’s advanced vision capabilities with sophisticated reasoning through reinforcement learning, enabling Operator to interact seamlessly with graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

### Key Features of CUA:

* **Visual Understanding:** Operator “sees” webpages through screenshots, allowing it to understand and interpret the visual layout of any interface.
    
* **GUI Interaction:** By mimicking mouse and keyboard actions, it can click buttons, type into text fields, scroll through pages, and more—all without requiring custom API integrations.
    
* **Adaptive Reasoning:** Should Operator encounter challenges or make errors, it leverages its reasoning capabilities to self-correct. When necessary, it will return control to the user, ensuring a smooth, collaborative experience.
    
* **State-of-the-Art Performance:** Despite being in its early stages, CUA has achieved new benchmark results in WebArena and WebVoyager, two critical assessments for browser interaction capabilities.
