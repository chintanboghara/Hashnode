## Introduction

In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced quickly, bringing us closer to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). A significant breakthrough in this field is the introduction of post-training methods, which have greatly improved reasoning accuracy, alignment with social values, and adaptability to user preferences. Unlike the expensive pre-training process, post-training offers a more efficient way to enhance model performance.

A recent major advancement in reasoning abilities came from OpenAI's o1 series models, which improved reasoning by extending the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process during inference. This approach has significantly enhanced mathematical reasoning, coding, and solving scientific problems. However, effectively scaling during testing remains an open research question. Various methods, such as process-based reward models, reinforcement learning, and search algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search and Beam Search, have been attempted, but none have fully matched the general reasoning performance of OpenAI's o1 series models.

This article discusses DeepSeek-R1, an innovative new LLM that enhances reasoning skills using pure reinforcement learning (RL) without the need for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). By using DeepSeek-V3-Base as the foundation and applying the Generalized Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally developed advanced reasoning abilities. After extensive RL training, DeepSeek-R1-Zero showed significant improvements on reasoning benchmarks, achieving near-human expert levels in math and coding tasks. However, to enhance language readability and consistency, the DeepSeek-R1 model underwent further refinement through a multi-stage training process, ultimately matching the performance of OpenAI's latest o1 models.

## The Evolution of DeepSeek-R1

### From DeepSeek-R1-Zero to DeepSeek-R1

DeepSeek-R1's journey started with DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which was trained solely using reinforcement learning, without any supervised fine-tuning. This method allowed the model to naturally develop reasoning skills, self-checking techniques, and an extended Chain-of-Thought process. The model showed remarkable improvements in reasoning benchmarks, including a significant increase in the pass@1 score on AIME 2024, jumping from 15.6% to 71.0%. With majority voting, performance further improved to 86.7%, matching OpenAI’s o1-0912 model.

Despite its strong reasoning skills, DeepSeek-R1-Zero had issues like poor readability and language mixing. To address these problems, DeepSeek-R1 was developed using a multi-stage training process that included both RL and SFT. The process involved:

1. **Cold-Start Data Fine-Tuning:** Thousands of initial training examples were used to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base model.
    
2. **Reasoning-Oriented RL:** Like DeepSeek-R1-Zero, RL was used to further enhance reasoning abilities.
    
3. **Supervised Data Augmentation:** New SFT data was created through rejection sampling on the RL checkpoint and combined with supervised datasets in writing, factual QA, and self-cognition.
    
4. **Final RL Training:** A final round of RL was conducted, using prompts from various scenarios.
    

This structured approach resulted in DeepSeek-R1, a model that reached reasoning performance comparable to OpenAI's o1-1217.

### Distillation: Making Smaller Models More Powerful

One of the major achievements of DeepSeek-R1 is its impact on model distillation. By transferring the reasoning patterns learned by DeepSeek-R1 to smaller models, researchers achieved better performance than smaller models trained with RL alone. The distilled models significantly outperformed previous open-source alternatives, proving that the reasoning strategies discovered by larger models are crucial for improving reasoning abilities.

Using Qwen2.5-32B as the base model, direct distillation from DeepSeek-R1 was more effective than applying RL to the smaller model. The distilled models also set new records in reasoning benchmarks among dense models. Notably, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieved a 55.5% pass@1 score on AIME 2024, surpassing QwQ-32B-Preview, while DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B attained:

* **72.6% on AIME 2024**
    
* **94.3% on MATH-500**
    
* **57.2% on LiveCodeBench**
    

These results demonstrate that the distilled models can achieve state-of-the-art performance, making them valuable for the research community. Open-source versions of the distilled models, including 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints, have been made available for further innovation and development.

## Performance and Benchmarking

DeepSeek-R1 has been thoroughly tested on various reasoning, knowledge, and general AI tasks. The results highlight its excellence in multiple areas:

### Reasoning Tasks

* **97.3% on MATH-500:** Matches OpenAI's latest models and greatly surpasses previous top models.
    
* **Coding Tasks:** Achieved a 2,029 Elo rating on Codeforces, outperforming 96.3% of human participants.
    
* **Engineering Tasks:** Surpassed DeepSeek-V3, making it highly useful for real-world applications.
    

### Knowledge-Based Tasks

* **90.8% on MMLU, 84.0% on MMLU-Pro, and 71.5% on GPQA Diamond:** Far exceeds DeepSeek-V3.
    
* **Fact-Based Queries:** Outperformed DeepSeek-V3 on SimpleQA, demonstrating superior factual reasoning skills.
    

### Other AI Tasks

* **Long-Context Understanding:** Significantly outperformed DeepSeek-V3 on long-context benchmarks.
    

## The Future of AI Reasoning

The development of DeepSeek-R1 marks a major step forward in AI research, especially in reasoning-focused reinforcement learning. The success of DeepSeek-R1-Zero shows that large language models can learn reasoning skills through pure RL, without needing supervised fine-tuning. This finding opens new paths for research into self-improving AI systems.

Moreover, DeepSeek-R1's ability to condense reasoning knowledge into smaller models highlights the potential for creating highly efficient AI models with excellent reasoning skills. By making both DeepSeek-R1 and its distilled models open-source, the research community gains access to advanced AI tools that can drive further progress in reasoning-based AI.

As AI models continue to develop, reinforcement learning methods like those used in DeepSeek-R1 will become increasingly important in shaping the next generation of intelligent systems. By using RL for self-improvement and optimizing reasoning processes, future LLMs may eventually close the gap between specialized AI models and true artificial general intelligence.

## Conclusion
