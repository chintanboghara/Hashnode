## 1\. Set Up a Remote Linux Server on AWS

1. **Create an AWS Account**: Sign up at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).
    
2. **Launch an EC2 Instance**:
    
    * Go to the EC2 Dashboard and click "Launch Instances."
        
    * Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), like Ubuntu Server or Amazon Linux.
        
    * Select an instance type, such as `t2.micro` for free-tier usage.
        
    * Set up network settings, making sure port 22 (SSH) is open in the security group.
        
    * Launch the instance and create an initial SSH key pair to download for the first connection.

## 2\. Create Two New SSH Key Pairs

1. **Generate Keys Locally**: Run the following command twice to create two separate key pairs:
    
    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/key1
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/key2
    ```
    
    Replace `key1` and `key2` with the filenames you want to use.
    
2. **Add Public Keys to the Server**:
    
    * Connect to the server using the initial SSH key:
        
        ```bash
        ssh -i <path-to-initial-private-key> ubuntu@<server-ip>
        ```
        
    * Add the new public keys to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the server:
        
        ```bash
        cat ~/.ssh/key1.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
        cat ~/.ssh/key2.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
        ```
        

## **3.** Test SSH Access with Both Keys

1. Connect using the first key:
    
    ```bash
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/key1 ubuntu@<server-ip>
    ```
    
2. Connect using the second key:
    
    ```bash
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/key2 ubuntu@<server-ip>
    ```
    

## **4\. Configure** `~/.ssh/config` for Easier Access

1. Edit the SSH config file:
    
    ```bash
    nano ~/.ssh/config
    ```
    
2. Add entries for both keys:
    
    ```plaintext
    Host alias1
        HostName <server-ip>
        User ubuntu
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/key1
    
    Host alias2
        HostName <server-ip>
        User ubuntu
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/key2
    ```
    
3. Save and test:
    
    ```bash
    ssh alias1
    ssh alias2
    ```
    

## **5.** Stretch Goal: Install and set up fail2ban

1. **Install fail2ban**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install fail2ban
    ```
    
2. **Configure fail2ban**:
    
    * Copy the default configuration:
        
        ```bash
        sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
        ```
        
    * Edit `jail.local` to enable the `sshd` jail and adjust the ban settings:
        
        ```bash
        [sshd]
        enabled = true
        port = ssh
        maxretry = 5
        bantime = 600
        ```
        
    * Restart fail2ban:
        
        ```bash
        sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
        ```
        
3. **Check Status**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo fail2ban-client status
    ```
    

By following these steps, you will have a secure server that can be accessed using two SSH keys, along with basic protection against brute-force attacks using fail2ban.
