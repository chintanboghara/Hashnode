# Introduction to Docker

**Docker** is a platform that lets developers automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. A container is a standardized unit of software that includes code and all its dependencies, ensuring the application runs quickly and reliably in various computing environments.

### Key Concepts

1. **Containers**: Containers are isolated environments that run applications and services. They are lightweight and share the host system's OS kernel, making them more efficient than traditional virtual machines.
    
2. **Images**: An image is a snapshot of a container's filesystem and configuration. It includes everything needed to run software, such as application code, libraries, and system tools. Docker images are usually built from a `Dockerfile`.
    
3. **Dockerfile**: A `Dockerfile` is a text file with instructions on how to build a Docker image. It specifies the base image, the software to install, and configuration tasks to perform.
    
4. **Docker Engine**: The Docker engine is the runtime that runs and manages containers. It consists of:
    
    * **Docker Daemon**: A background process that manages Docker containers.
        
    * **Docker CLI**: A command-line interface to interact with the Docker daemon.
        
5. **Docker Hub**: Docker Hub is a cloud-based repository where Docker users can share and store their images. It's like GitHub for Docker images. You can download official images or upload your own to share.
    

### Key Benefits of Docker

1. **Portability**: Docker containers run the same way in any environment, whether it's development, testing, or production. This solves the "it works on my machine" issue.
    
2. **Isolation**: Containers keep processes and file systems separate. Each container has its own environment, allowing you to run multiple versions of the same application or different applications without conflicts.
    
3. **Efficiency**: Containers are lightweight and start quickly because they share the operating system kernel, unlike virtual machines that need a full operating system.
    
4. **Version Control**: Docker images are version-controlled, making it easy to roll back or update to specific versions of an application.
    
5. **Scalability**: Docker containers can be easily scaled up or down to meet demand, which is crucial for deploying microservices and large-scale applications.
    

### Common Docker Commands

1. **docker build**: Builds a Docker image from a `Dockerfile`.
    
    ```plaintext
    docker build -t myapp .
    ```
    
2. **docker run**: Runs a container from a specified image.
    
    ```plaintext
    docker run -d -p 8080:80 myapp
    ```
    
3. **docker ps**: Lists running containers.
    
    ```plaintext
    docker ps
    ```
    
4. **docker stop**: Stops a running container.
    
    ```plaintext
    docker stop container_id
    ```
    
5. **docker pull**: Downloads an image from Docker Hub.
    
    ```plaintext
    docker pull nginx
    ```
    
6. **docker push**: Pushes a local image to Docker Hub.
    
    ```plaintext
    docker push myapp
    ```
    

### Docker Use Cases

1. **Microservices**: Docker is often used to deploy microservices, with each service running in its own container. This setup allows for easy updates and scaling.
    
2. **CI/CD**: Docker makes continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines simpler by offering reproducible environments for testing and production.
    
3. **Development and Testing**: Developers can use Docker to mimic production environments locally, ensuring the application behaves consistently in both settings.
    
4. **Multi-Cloud Environments**: Docker containers can run on any cloud provider, making it easy to switch between different cloud environments without compatibility issues.
    

# Docker Architecture

Docker uses a client-server architecture and depends on several key components to work efficiently. These components collaborate to help you develop, deploy, and manage containers. The architecture includes:

1. **Docker Client**
    
2. **Docker Daemon (Docker Engine)**
    
3. **Docker Registry**
    
4. **Docker Images**
    
5. **Docker Containers**
    

### 1\. **Docker Client**

The Docker client is a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI) that developers and administrators use to interact with Docker. It sends requests to the Docker daemon (the server) and receives responses.

* **Docker CLI**: The most common client is the Docker CLI, where you run commands like `docker run`, `docker build`, or `docker ps`.
    
* **Docker GUI**: Tools like Docker Desktop offer a graphical interface for managing containers and images on local machines.
    

The Docker client communicates with the Docker daemon through REST API requests over a network, either local or remote. You can connect to a Docker daemon running on your local machine or on a remote server.

### 2\. **Docker Daemon (Docker Engine)**

The Docker Daemon, also known as the Docker Engine, is a server-side process that manages containers. It listens for Docker API requests from the Docker client and carries out tasks like building, running, and managing containers.

* **Responsibilities**:
    
    * Managing Docker containers (starting, stopping, and monitoring them)
        
    * Managing Docker images (building and pulling images)
        
    * Handling container networking, storage, and volumes
        
    * Ensuring containers are isolated and run efficiently
        
* **Components of the Docker Daemon**:
    
    * **Docker API**: Provides the interfaces (REST API) for the client to interact with the Docker daemon.
        
    * **Container Runtime**: Manages the lifecycle of containers (starting, stopping, and deleting containers).
        
    * **Image Management**: Handles pulling, building, and storing images.
        
    * **Network and Volume Management**: Configures networking and volumes for containers.
        

### 3\. **Docker Registry**

A **Docker Registry** is a storage location for Docker images. It lets you share and access images. The most popular Docker registry is **Docker Hub**, but you can also use others like **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**, **Google Container Registry (GCR)**, or private registries.

* **Public Registry**: Docker Hub is the default public registry, where you can find many pre-built images, such as official images for databases, web servers, and application runtimes.
    
* **Private Registry**: You can create your own private registry to securely store your organization's images.
    

When you run a command like `docker pull <image_name>`, Docker retrieves the image from the registry and downloads it to your local system.

### 4\. **Docker Images**

A **Docker Image** is a read-only template that sets up the environment for your container. An image includes everything needed to run an application, such as:

* The application code
    
* Runtime libraries
    
* Dependencies
    
* Environment variables
    
* Configuration files
    

Images are created using a `Dockerfile`, which contains instructions for building the image.

* **Layers**: Docker images are made up of layers. Each instruction in a Dockerfile (e.g., `RUN`, `COPY`, `ADD`) creates a new layer, which can be cached for efficiency.
    
* **Base Image**: You often start with a base image, like an official operating system image (such as `ubuntu` or `alpine`), and then add your application's dependencies on top of it.
    

Once an image is built, it can be pushed to a registry (e.g., Docker Hub) for distribution and sharing.

### 5\. **Docker Containers**

A **Docker Container** is a running instance of a Docker image. When you run a Docker image, it turns into a container. Containers are separate from each other and the host system, but they share the OS kernel.

* **Isolation**: Containers offer isolation for CPU, memory, file system, and networking, making them lightweight and efficient compared to virtual machines.
    
* **Ephemeral**: By default, containers are temporary, meaning they can be easily stopped, started, or removed.
    
* **Networking**: Containers can communicate with each other using Dockerâ€™s networking features. Docker offers several networking modes like bridge, host, and overlay networking.
    
* **Volumes**: Docker containers use volumes to keep data even after a container is removed. Volumes are stored outside the container's file system but are accessible to containers.
    
* **Namespaces**: Docker uses Linux namespaces (such as PID, Network, Mount, and UTS namespaces) to keep containers separate from the host and each other.
    

### Docker Architecture Overview

The interaction between the components in Docker architecture is as follows:

1. **Docker Client** sends commands to the **Docker Daemon** through the Docker API. These commands can include creating, starting, stopping, or managing containers.
    
2. **Docker Daemon** builds, runs, and manages containers based on instructions from the client. It pulls images from the **Docker Registry**, manages containers, and handles networking and storage for containers.
    
3. **Docker Images** define the container environment and are stored either locally or in a registry.
    
4. **Docker Containers** run the applications, using the environment and dependencies defined by the images.

#### **For Windows 10 Home Users (WSL 2 Required)**

If you are using Windows 10 Home, follow these additional steps to install Docker:

1. **Install WSL 2**  
    Docker Desktop requires Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2) on Windows Home. To install WSL 2, you must first enable the WSL feature:
    
    * Open PowerShell as an administrator and run the following:
        
        ```bash
        wsl --install
        ```
        
2. **Set WSL 2 as Default**  
    After installation, run this command to make sure that WSL 2 is the default version:
    
    ```bash
    wsl --set-default-version 2
    ```
    
3. **Download and Install Docker Desktop**  
    Follow the same steps mentioned for Windows Pro and Enterprise to install Docker Desktop for Windows.
    
4. **Verify the Installation**  
    After installation, you can verify Docker by running:
    
    ```bash
    docker --version
    ```
    

## 4\. **Verifying Docker Installation**

Once Docker is installed, you can check if it was installed correctly by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
docker --version
```

To verify that Docker is running correctly, you can also run the `hello-world` container:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

This command will pull a test image from Docker Hub (if it's not already available locally) and run it in a container. If everything is set up correctly, youâ€™ll see a success message.

# Docker Images

A **Docker image** is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes all the code, libraries, dependencies, and settings needed to run software. It acts as the blueprint for creating Docker containers. Docker images are read-only templates, and when you run a container, the Docker engine adds a writable layer on top of the image.

Images are built from **Dockerfiles**, which contain the instructions for creating the image. Docker images are stored in a registry (e.g., Docker Hub), making them easy to share and distribute.

### Key Characteristics of Docker Images

1. **Read-Only**: Docker images cannot be changed and are read-only. When you run a container from an image, the container itself can be written to.
    
2. **Layered Architecture**: Images consist of multiple layers. Each command in a Dockerfile (like `RUN`, `COPY`, `ADD`) creates a new layer. These layers are cached, which speeds up the build process.
    
3. **Portable**: Docker images include everything an application needs to run, making it easy to deploy the same image in different environments without compatibility problems.
    
4. **Versioned**: Images can have tags (such as `myapp:1.0` or `nginx:latest`) to keep track of different versions of an image.
    

### Docker Image Structure

A Docker image is made up of multiple layers, each representing a different stage in the build process:

1. **Base Layer**: This is the foundational layer of the image, usually a minimal operating system like `alpine` or `ubuntu`.
    
2. **Application Layer**: This layer includes the application and all its dependencies, such as libraries and configuration files.
    
3. **Metadata Layer**: This layer contains metadata about the image, like environment variables and configuration instructions.
    

Each layer builds on the one before it. Docker uses a layered filesystem called **UnionFS** to manage these layers efficiently.

### Creating Docker Images

#### 1\. **Dockerfile**

A **Dockerfile** is a script with a series of instructions for building a Docker image. Each instruction adds a layer to the image.

Example `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official base image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the package.json and install dependencies
COPY package.json /app/
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . /app/

# Expose the application port
EXPOSE 3000

# Define the command to run the app
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

* **FROM**: Specifies the base image (e.g., `node:14`).
    
* **WORKDIR**: Sets the working directory inside the container.
    
* **COPY**: Copies files or directories from the host system into the image.
    
* **RUN**: Executes commands, such as installing dependencies.
    
* **EXPOSE**: Opens a port that the container will use.
    
* **CMD**: Sets the default command to run when the container starts.
    

#### 2\. **Building a Docker Image**

To create a Docker image from a Dockerfile, use the `docker build` command:

```bash
docker build -t myapp:1.0 .
```

* `-t myapp:1.0`: This option tags the image with the name `myapp` and version `1.0`.
    
* `.`: The period (`.`) indicates the current directory, which contains the `Dockerfile`.
    

This command will run the instructions in the `Dockerfile` and create a new image.

### Working with Docker Images

#### 1\. **Listing Docker Images**

You can see the list of images stored locally on your system by using the following command:

```bash
docker images
```

This command will show a table of images, including the image name, tag, image ID, creation date, and size.

#### 2\. **Pulling Docker Images**

To download an image from a registry (like Docker Hub), use the `docker pull` command:

```bash
docker pull nginx
```

This command will download the latest version of the `nginx` image from Docker Hub.

You can also download a specific version (tag) of an image:

```bash
docker pull node:14
```

#### 3\. **Tagging Docker Images**

You can tag a Docker image to create different versions of the same image. Use the `docker tag` command:

```bash
docker tag myapp:1.0 myapp:latest
```

This command tags the `myapp:1.0` image with the `latest` tag, so you can refer to it using multiple tags.

#### 4\. **Pushing Docker Images to a Registry**

To upload your image to a registry (like Docker Hub), first log in to your Docker account and then use the `docker push` command:

```bash
docker login
docker push myapp:1.0
```

This will upload the `myapp:1.0` image to Docker Hub, allowing you to access it from anywhere.

#### 5\. **Removing Docker Images**

You can remove a Docker image using the `docker rmi` command:

```bash
docker rmi myapp:1.0
```

This will remove the image `myapp:1.0` from your local machine. You might need to stop any running containers that use this image before deleting it.

### Docker Image Registries

1. **Docker Hub**: This is the default public registry for Docker images. You can find official images here, including those for databases, web servers, and programming languages.
    
2. **Private Registries**: You can create your own private registry to store and share images securely within your organization. Tools like **Harbor** and **Amazon ECR** offer private registry solutions.
    

### Docker Image Layers and Caching

Docker uses a layered structure for images. Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a new image layer. Docker uses a **cache** for these layers to make image builds faster:

* **Layer Caching**: If a layer hasn't changed (like the base image or a set of dependencies), Docker will use the cached version of that layer instead of rebuilding it.
    
* **Cache Busting**: If you need Docker to rebuild a layer (for example, when installing dependencies), you can change the Dockerfile to break the cache. For instance, altering the `COPY` instruction can trigger a rebuild.
    

### Example: Building a Docker Image for a Web Application

Hereâ€™s a simple example of building a Docker image for a Node.js web application:

1. **Create a project directory** and navigate to it:
    
    ```bash
    mkdir myapp
    cd myapp
    ```
    
2. **Create a** `Dockerfile`:
    
    ```Dockerfile
    FROM node:14
    
    WORKDIR /app
    
    COPY package.json /app/
    RUN npm install
    
    COPY . /app/
    
    EXPOSE 3000
    
    CMD ["npm", "start"]
    ```
    
3. **Create an application**: Add a simple `package.json` file and `index.js` file to the directory.
    
4. **Build the Docker image**:
    
    ```bash
    docker build -t myapp .
    ```
    
5. **Run the Docker container**:
    
    ```bash
    docker run -p 3000:3000 myapp
    ```
    

# Docker Containers

A **Docker container** is a lightweight, standalone package that includes everything needed to run softwareâ€”code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files. Containers are instances of Docker images that run in isolated environments. Unlike traditional virtual machines, containers share the host operating system's kernel, making them more efficient and portable.

In Docker, **containers** offer an isolated environment for applications, ensuring they run consistently across different systems. When you create a Docker container, it uses a Docker image as its base, and you can start, stop, or interact with it using Docker commands.

### Key Characteristics of Docker Containers

1. **Isolation**: Containers run in separate environments. Each container has its own file system, network, and process space, separate from other containers and the host system.
    
2. **Lightweight**: Containers are lightweight because they share the host OS kernel instead of running a separate OS like virtual machines. This makes containers quicker to start and more efficient in using resources.
    
3. **Ephemeral**: Containers are meant to be temporary and disposable. Once a container stops, it can be removed. However, you can use Docker volumes to save data across container restarts.
    
4. **Portability**: Containers include all dependencies and configurations, ensuring that applications run the same on any system with Docker installed. This is important for consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
    

### Docker Container Lifecycle

The lifecycle of a Docker container generally includes the following stages:

1. **Creating a Container**: When you run a container, Docker creates an instance from a specified image.
    
2. **Running the Container**: Once created, the container starts running the application specified in the image, like a web server or database.
    
3. **Stopping the Container**: A running container can be stopped, which pauses its processes without deleting it.
    
4. **Removing the Container**: After a container is stopped, you can remove it, which deletes the container and frees up resources.
    

### Working with Docker Containers

#### 1\. **Creating and Running a Container**

To create and run a container from a Docker image, use the `docker run` command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name mycontainer nginx
```

* `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
    
* `-p 8080:80`: Maps port 8080 on the host to port 80 inside the container.
    
* `--name mycontainer`: Assigns a name to the container (optional).
    
* `nginx`: Specifies the image to use (in this case, the official Nginx image).
    

This command will:

1. Download the `nginx` image from Docker Hub (if itâ€™s not already present).
    
2. Create and start a new container named `mycontainer` from the `nginx` image.
    
3. Expose port 80 inside the container and map it to port 8080 on the host system.
    

You can now access the Nginx web server in your browser by going to [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080).

#### 2\. **Listing Running Containers**

To see the containers that are currently running, use:

```bash
docker ps
```

This command will show information about the running containers, such as the container ID, image, status, and ports.

If you want to list all containers, including those that are stopped, use:

```bash
docker ps -a
```

#### 3\. **Stopping a Container**

To stop a running container, use the `docker stop` command followed by the container's name or ID:

```bash
docker stop mycontainer
```

This will gracefully stop the container named `mycontainer`.

#### 4\. **Removing a Container**

To remove a stopped container, use the `docker rm` command:

```bash
docker rm mycontainer
```

This will remove the container named `mycontainer`. Remember, a container must be stopped before it can be removed.

#### 5\. **Starting a Stopped Container**

You can start a previously stopped container by using:

```bash
docker start mycontainer
```

#### 6\. **Accessing a Running Container**

To access a running container and interact with its environment, use the `docker exec` command. For example, to open a shell inside the container:

```bash
docker exec -it mycontainer bash
```

* `-it`: Combines the `-i` (interactive) and `-t` (allocate a terminal) flags to enable interactive use.
    
* `bash`: Starts the `bash` shell inside the container (you can use other shells like `sh` depending on the container).
    

This command opens an interactive terminal session inside the container, allowing you to run commands directly.

#### 7\. **Viewing Container Logs**

To see the logs of a running or stopped container, use the `docker logs` command:

```bash
docker logs mycontainer
```

This will show the logs created by the container, which can help with debugging.

#### 8\. **Restarting a Container**

You can restart a container using the `docker restart` command:

```bash
docker restart mycontainer
```

This command stops the container and then immediately restarts it.

#### 9\. **Viewing Container Resource Usage**

To check the resource usage of running containers, like CPU and memory usage, use:

```bash
docker stats
```

This command will show real-time statistics for all running containers.

### Docker Container Networking

Docker containers are isolated from each other and from the host machine by default, but they can communicate with each other using Docker's networking features. When you run a container, Docker assigns it to a default network, usually a bridge network.

Here are some common networking options:

1. **Bridge Network** (default): Containers on the same bridge network can communicate with each other using their IP addresses.
    
2. **Host Network**: The container shares the network namespace with the host. This is useful when you need a container to directly access host resources.
    
3. **Overlay Network**: Used for multi-host networking, it allows containers on different Docker hosts to communicate with each other.
    
4. **None Network**: Disables networking for a container, isolating it from the network.
    

To connect a container to a specific network, use the `--network` flag when starting a container:

```bash
docker run --network mynetwork mycontainer
```

### Docker Volumes and Data Persistence

By default, containers have temporary storage, meaning that when a container is removed, its data is also lost. To keep data even after a container is deleted, Docker offers **volumes**.

#### 1\. **Creating a Volume**

To create a volume:

```bash
docker volume create myvolume
```

#### 2\. **Mounting a Volume**

To mount a volume into a container, use the `-v` or `--mount` option with the `docker run` command:

```bash
docker run -v myvolume:/data mycontainer
```

This mounts the `myvolume` volume to the `/data` directory inside the container. Any data written to `/data` will be saved even after the container is removed.

### Docker Container Lifecycle Example

Here's an example of how to use Docker containers in practice:

1. **Run a container** with the official Nginx image:
    
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name mynginx nginx
    ```
    
2. **List containers**:
    
    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```
    
3. **Stop the container**:
    
    ```bash
    docker stop mynginx
    ```
    
4. **Remove the container**:
    
    ```bash
    docker rm mynginx
    ```
    
5. **Run the container again**, this time with a volume mounted:
    
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 8080:80 -v myvolume:/usr/share/nginx/html --name mynginx nginx
    ```
    

# Docker Networking

Docker networking lets containers communicate with each other and with the outside world. By default, Docker offers several network modes to support different needs. Understanding Docker networking is crucial for ensuring proper communication between containers, services, and the host machine.

Docker offers various networking options, such as **bridge**, **host**, **overlay**, **none**, and custom networks. These networks decide how containers interact with each other, the host system, and external networks.

### Types of Docker Networks

1. **Bridge Network (Default)**
    
    * **Purpose**: The **bridge network** is the default network mode for containers when no network is specified.
        
    * **How it works**: When a container is connected to the bridge network, Docker creates a virtual bridge (usually `docker0` on the host), and containers are assigned unique IP addresses on that bridge. Containers on the same bridge network can communicate with each other using their IP addresses, but they cannot access the host network directly.
        
    * **Use case**: This mode is typically used for containers running on a single host where you donâ€™t need to expose ports to the host machine.
        
    
    **Example**:
    
    ```bash
    docker run -d --name container1 --network bridge nginx
    docker run -d --name container2 --network bridge nginx
    ```
    
2. **Host Network**
    
    * **Purpose**: In **host network mode**, containers share the host's network namespace, which means they can access the host's network interfaces directly.
        
    * **How it works**: A container running in host network mode does not get its own IP address but shares the host's IP address. The container uses the same network interfaces as the host machine, so it can communicate directly with the outside world.
        
    * **Use case**: This mode is useful when you want the container to have direct access to the hostâ€™s network (for example, for performance-critical applications).
        
    
    **Example**:
    
    ```bash
    docker run -d --name container1 --network host nginx
    ```
    
    **Note**: Host networking is not available on Windows containers.
    
3. **Overlay Network**
    
    * **Purpose**: **Overlay networks** are used to enable communication between containers across multiple Docker hosts. This is commonly used in Docker Swarm or Kubernetes for multi-host container orchestration.
        
    * **How it works**: Overlay networks create a virtual network that spans multiple hosts, allowing containers to communicate as if they were on the same physical network. Docker uses VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN) to create the virtual network.
        
    * **Use case**: This mode is used in orchestration environments, such as Docker Swarm, where containers need to communicate across different machines.
        
    
    **Example**:
    
    ```bash
    docker network create -d overlay my_overlay_network
    ```
    
4. **None Network**
    
    * **Purpose**: The **none network mode** is used when you donâ€™t want a container to have any network connectivity at all.
        
    * **How it works**: Containers connected to the `none` network are completely isolated from the network. This can be useful when you need a container with no network access (for example, in a security-sensitive application).
        
    * **Use case**: Used for highly isolated containers where network communication is not necessary.
        
    
    **Example**:
    
    ```bash
    docker run -d --name container1 --network none nginx
    ```
    
5. **Custom Networks (User-defined Networks)**
    
    * **Purpose**: **Custom networks** allow you to define specific network settings, such as subnet and gateway, and provide better isolation and communication between containers.
        
    * **How it works**: When you create a custom network, Docker automatically creates a DNS-based service discovery system for containers, so they can refer to each other by container name (instead of IP address). Docker also allows more fine-grained control over IP addresses and subnets.
        
    * **Use case**: Custom networks are ideal for scenarios where you need to configure network settings for specific containers or groups of containers. This is typically used in microservices and multi-container applications.
        
    
    **Example**:
    
    1. Create a custom bridge network:
        
        ```bash
        docker network create --driver bridge my_custom_network
        ```
        
    2. Run containers on the custom network:
        
        ```bash
        docker run -d --name container1 --network my_custom_network nginx
        docker run -d --name container2 --network my_custom_network nginx
        ```
        

### Docker Network Drivers

Docker supports several **network drivers** that determine how networking is managed in Docker containers. The most commonly used drivers are:

1. **bridge**: The default driver, used for communication between containers on a single host.
    
2. **host**: Used when containers share the hostâ€™s network stack.
    
3. **overlay**: Used for networking across multiple hosts, typically in Swarm or Kubernetes.
    
4. **macvlan**: Allows containers to have their own MAC address and appear as physical devices on the network.
    
5. **none**: No networking is provided.
    
6. **custom drivers**: Docker lets you create custom network drivers if needed.
    

### Creating and Managing Docker Networks

Here are some useful Docker commands to create, inspect, and remove networks.

#### 1\. **Creating a Custom Network**

To create a custom network with a specific driver (e.g., `bridge`):

```bash
docker network create --driver bridge my_custom_network
```

To create a network with specific subnets:

```bash
docker network create --driver bridge --subnet 192.168.1.0/24 my_custom_network
```

#### 2\. **Listing Networks**

To list all networks available on your Docker host:

```bash
docker network ls
```

#### 3\. **Inspecting a Network**

To view detailed information about a network:

```bash
docker network inspect my_custom_network
```

#### 4\. **Connecting a Container to a Network**

To connect a running container to an existing network:

```bash
docker network connect my_custom_network my_container
```

#### 5\. **Disconnecting a Container from a Network**

To disconnect a container from a network:

```bash
docker network disconnect my_custom_network my_container
```

#### 6\. **Removing a Network**

To remove a network (make sure no containers are connected to it):

```bash
docker network rm my_custom_network
```

### DNS and Service Discovery in Docker Networks

When containers are connected to a custom network, Docker provides automatic **DNS resolution**. Containers can communicate with each other using their container names instead of IP addresses.

For example:

1. If you run two containers (`container1` and `container2`) on the same network, you can use `container1` as the hostname to connect to `container1` from `container2`.
    
    ```bash
    docker run -d --name container1 --network my_custom_network nginx
    docker run -d --name container2 --network my_custom_network nginx
    ```
    
2. From `container2`, you can ping `container1`:
    
    ```bash
    docker exec -it container2 ping container1
    ```
    

### Docker Compose and Networking

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. Docker Compose automatically creates a network for your application, and containers within the same application can communicate with each other using their service names.

**Example** `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    networks:
      - my_network
  app:
    image: myapp
    networks:
      - my_network

networks:
  my_network:
    driver: bridge
```

In this example:

* The `web` and `app` services are connected to the same custom network (`my_network`).
    
* Containers can communicate with each other using the service names (`web` and `app`).
    

# Docker Volumes and Storage

Docker volumes are crucial for saving data in Docker containers. Normally, data created inside a container is temporary and disappears when the container is removed. To solve this problem, Docker offers **volumes**, which let you save and share data across containers and even after they restart.

Besides volumes, Docker also supports other storage options like **bind mounts** and **tmpfs** mounts. Knowing when and how to use these different storage methods can help you manage data effectively in your containerized applications.

### Docker Volumes

#### What is a Volume?

A **Docker volume** is a special storage area managed by Docker that keeps data safe even after a container is stopped or removed. Volumes are stored outside the containerâ€™s filesystem, making them perfect for holding data that should last through container restarts, upgrades, or even deletions.

Docker volumes are especially helpful in these situations:

* Storing database data
    
* Sharing data between multiple containers
    
* Storing application logs and configurations
    
* Keeping configuration files safe
    

#### Benefits of Using Volumes

1. **Persistence**: Volumes retain data even after containers are removed or stopped.
    
2. **Isolation**: Volumes are managed by Docker and are isolated from the container filesystem, reducing the risk of data loss.
    
3. **Sharing Data**: Multiple containers can mount the same volume, allowing them to share data.
    
4. **Performance**: Volumes are optimized for performance and are typically faster than bind mounts for certain use cases.
    
5. **Backup and Restore**: Volumes can be easily backed up, restored, or moved to another system.
    

#### Working with Docker Volumes

##### 1\. **Creating a Volume**

To create a volume, use the `docker volume create` command:

```bash
docker volume create my_volume
```

This creates a new volume named `my_volume`. You can view all volumes with:

```bash
docker volume ls
```

##### 2\. **Listing Volumes**

To list all volumes on the Docker host:

```bash
docker volume ls
```

##### 3\. **Inspecting a Volume**

To view details about a volume:

```bash
docker volume inspect my_volume
```

This provides information such as the mount point on the host system and the volumeâ€™s configuration.

##### 4\. **Mounting a Volume in a Container**

When running a container, you can mount a volume to a specific path inside the container using the `-v` or `--mount` flag.

* **Syntax**:
    
    ```bash
    docker run -d -v my_volume:/path/in/container my_image
    ```
    
* This command mounts the `my_volume` volume to `/path/in/container` inside the container. Any changes made in this path will be persisted in the volume.
    

For example, mounting a volume for a database container:

```bash
docker run -d -v db_data:/var/lib/mysql --name mysql-container mysql:latest
```

##### 5\. **Removing a Volume**

To remove a volume when it is no longer needed:

```bash
docker volume rm my_volume
```

Note: A volume can only be removed if it is not in use by any containers. You can check which containers are using a volume with:

```bash
docker ps -a --filter volume=my_volume
```

##### 6\. **Pruning Unused Volumes**

Docker provides a command to clean up unused volumes to free up space:

```bash
docker volume prune
```

This removes all volumes that are not being used by any containers.

### Bind Mounts

#### What is a Bind Mount?

A **bind mount** allows you to mount a file or directory from the host system into the container. Unlike volumes, which are managed by Docker, bind mounts link to the actual filesystem paths on the host system.

Bind mounts are useful when you want to:

* Share specific files or directories between the host and the container.
    
* Develop locally while reflecting changes immediately inside the container.
    

#### How Bind Mounts Work

* The host path must exist before mounting it.
    
* The container has direct access to the host's filesystem, meaning changes to the mounted path affect both the host and the container.
    

**Example**:

```bash
docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/path/in/container my_image
```

This command mounts the host directory `/path/on/host` to `/path/in/container` inside the container. Any file changes in this directory are reflected on both the host and container.

### Tmpfs Mounts

#### What is a Tmpfs Mount?

A **tmpfs mount** stores data in the host systemâ€™s memory instead of on the disk. This data is temporary and non-persistent, meaning it is lost when the container stops.

#### Use Cases

* Temporarily storing sensitive data, like passwords or tokens.
    
* Storing caches that don't need to last between container runs.
    

**Example**:

```bash
docker run -d --mount type=tmpfs,target=/tmp my_image
```

This creates a tmpfs mount at `/tmp` inside the container, and the data stored in that directory will be stored in memory and lost after the container stops.

### Managing Docker Volumes and Storage

#### 1\. **Mounting a Volume in Docker Compose**

In **Docker Compose**, you can specify volumes in the `docker-compose.yml` file, and they are automatically created when you start your services.

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  db:
    image: mysql
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  db_data:
```

This configuration will create a named volume `db_data`, which will persist the database data across container restarts.

#### 2\. **Copying Data to/from a Volume**

You can copy data to or from a Docker volume using the `docker cp` command, which allows you to copy files between a container and the local filesystem.

To copy a file from the container to the host:

```bash
docker cp container_id:/path/in/container /path/on/host
```

To copy a file from the host to the container:

```bash
docker cp /path/on/host container_id:/path/in/container
```

#### 3\. **Backup and Restore Volumes**

To back up data in a volume, you can use the `docker run` command with a container that can access the volume and perform the backup.

**Backup**:

```bash
docker run --rm -v my_volume:/volume -v $(pwd):/backup busybox tar czf /backup/backup.tar.gz -C /volume .
```

This command creates a backup of the `my_volume` volume as a tarball (`backup.tar.gz`) in the current directory.

**Restore**:

```bash
docker run --rm -v my_volume:/volume -v $(pwd):/backup busybox tar xzf /backup/backup.tar.gz -C /volume
```

This restores the backup from the tarball into the `my_volume` volume.

### Comparing Docker Storage Methods

| **Feature** | **Volumes** | **Bind Mounts** | **Tmpfs** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Managed by Docker** | Yes | No | No |
| **Location** | Stored in Docker's storage | Host file system | In memory |
| **Persistence** | Persistent | Persistent (host-dependent) | Temporary (volatile) |
| **Use Case** | Application data, logs | Sharing files between host and container | Sensitive or ephemeral data |
| **Backup/Restore** | Easy to backup and restore | Manually copy data | Not applicable |

# Docker Compose

**Docker Compose** is a tool that lets you define and manage applications with multiple Docker containers. With Compose, you can set up your application's services, networks, and volumes in a YAML file, and then start all the services with one command. This is particularly helpful for applications made up of several services, like a web server, database, and cache.

### Key Concepts in Docker Compose

1. **Services**: A service is typically a container or set of containers that work together to perform a specific task. For example, a web service and a database service could be part of the same application.
    
2. **Networks**: Networks allow containers to communicate with each other. Compose automatically creates a default network for your services, but you can also define custom networks.
    
3. **Volumes**: Volumes allow data to persist between container restarts and to be shared between containers.
    
4. **Docker Compose File (**`docker-compose.yml`): This YAML file defines the configuration for all the services, networks, and volumes that make up your application.
    

### Basic `docker-compose.yml` Structure

A typical `docker-compose.yml` file consists of several sections: **version**, **services**, **networks**, and **volumes**.

Hereâ€™s an example of a simple `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html
    networks:
      - app-network

  db:
    image: mysql:latest
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: examplepassword
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/mysql
    networks:
      - app-network

volumes:
  db-data:

networks:
  app-network:
```

### Explanation of the `docker-compose.yml` file

* **version**: Indicates the version of the Compose file format (here, version 3).
    
* **services**: Lists the containers that make up your application.
    
    * **web**: This service uses the `nginx` image, maps port 8080 on the host to port 80 in the container, and links a local directory (`./html`) to a directory inside the container (`/usr/share/nginx/html`).
        
    * **db**: This service uses the `mysql` image, sets an environment variable for the root password, and uses a named volume (`db-data`) to keep database data.
        
* **volumes**: Lists the named volumes. The `db-data` volume stores MySQL data.
    
* **networks**: Lists custom networks. The `app-network` lets both `web` and `db` services communicate with each other.
    

### Basic Docker Compose Commands

1. **Starting the Application**:  
    Once youâ€™ve defined your `docker-compose.yml` file, you can start the services by running:
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```
    
    This will:
    
    * Pull the necessary images if they donâ€™t exist locally.
        
    * Create containers for each service.
        
    * Start all services in the foreground.
        
    
    To run the services in the background (detached mode), add the `-d` flag:
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    
2. **Stopping the Application**:  
    To stop all the services, run:
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```
    
    This will stop and remove all the containers, networks, and volumes created by `docker-compose up`.
    
3. **Viewing Logs**:  
    You can view the logs of all services or a specific service by running:
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs
    ```
    
    For specific service logs:
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs web
    ```
    
4. **Scaling Services**:  
    Docker Compose allows you to scale services by specifying how many containers (replicas) of a service you want to run. For example, to run 3 instances of the `web` service:
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --scale web=3
    ```
    
5. **Viewing Running Services**:  
    To see the status of running services and containers:
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose ps
    ```
    
6. **Building Images**:  
    If your `docker-compose.yml` file defines a service that requires building a custom image (e.g., using a `Dockerfile`), you can build the image using:
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose build
    ```
    
7. **Running a One-Off Command**:  
    To execute a one-off command in a running service, you can use `docker-compose exec`. For example, to open a bash shell in the `web` service:
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec web bash
    ```
    

### Example of Multi-Container Application

Here's an example of a more complex application that includes a web server (using Nginx), a PHP application, and a database (MySQL), all managed by Docker Compose.

#### `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html
    networks:
      - app-network

  php:
    image: php:7.4-fpm
    volumes:
      - ./html:/var/www/html
    networks:
      - app-network

  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: examplepassword
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/mysql
    networks:
      - app-network

volumes:
  db-data:

networks:
  app-network:
```

#### File Structure

```plaintext
.
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml
â””â”€â”€ html
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.php
```

#### Explanation

* The `web` service runs Nginx and exposes port 8080. It shares the `html` directory from the host with `/usr/share/nginx/html` in the container.
    
* The `php` service runs PHP-FPM to process PHP code. It uses the same `html` directory as the `web` service.
    
* The `db` service runs a MySQL database with a persistent volume to store the database files.
    
* All services are connected to a shared network, `app-network`.
    

In this example, you can visit [`localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) to see the application served by Nginx, and the PHP application will interact with the MySQL database.

### Advanced Docker Compose Features

1. **Environment Variables**:  
    You can pass environment variables to services in the `docker-compose.yml` file or via a `.env` file.
    
    Example of `.env` file:
    
    ```plaintext
    MYSQL_PASSWORD=examplepassword
    ```
    
    Reference in `docker-compose.yml`:
    
    ```yaml
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${MYSQL_PASSWORD}
    ```
    
2. **Override Configuration**:  
    Docker Compose allows you to override configurations in a secondary file. For example, you could have a `docker-compose.override.yml` for development-specific configurations:
    
    ```yaml
    version: '3'
    services:
      web:
        ports:
          - "8081:80"
    ```
    
    By default, Docker Compose automatically includes `docker-compose.override.yml` when you run `docker-compose up`.
    
3. **Depends On**:  
    The `depends_on` option is used to control the startup order of services. However, it doesnâ€™t wait for a service to be fully ready before starting dependent services.
    
    ```yaml
    services:
      web:
        image: nginx
        depends_on:
          - db
    ```
    
4. **Health Checks**:  
    You can define a health check for a service to ensure that it is healthy before Docker Compose starts other services depending on it.
    
    ```yaml
    services:
      db:
        image: mysql
        healthcheck:
          test: ["CMD", "mysqladmin", "ping", "-u", "root", "-pexamplepassword"]
          interval: 30s
          retries: 3
    ```
    

# Docker Registry

A **Docker Registry** is a central place where Docker images are stored, shared, and managed. It allows users to pull images for their Docker containers or push images they've created locally for sharing or deployment. Registries are crucial to the Docker ecosystem, helping to distribute images and support containerized application workflows.

### Key Components of Docker Registry

1. **Docker Hub**:
    
    * The default public Docker registry hosted by Docker Inc.
        
    * Contains millions of publicly available images from official and community sources.
        
    * URL: [https://hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com)
        
2. **Private Docker Registries**:
    
    * Organizations can host their own private registries to store and manage images securely.
        
    * Tools like Dockerâ€™s **Registry** (open-source) or third-party solutions (e.g., AWS Elastic Container Registry, GitHub Container Registry) are used for private registries.
        
3. **Images**:
    
    * Images stored in a registry are identified by names and tags, e.g., `nginx:latest`.
        
    * Tags are used to specify different versions of an image.
        
4. **Repository**:
    
    * A repository is a collection of related images with the same name but different tags. For example, `nginx` is a repository with tags like `latest`, `1.21.3`, etc.
        

### Working with Docker Registry

#### 1\. **Pulling Images from a Registry**

To use an image from a registry, pull it using the `docker pull` command:

```bash
docker pull nginx:latest
```

This command:

* Fetches the `nginx` image with the `latest` tag from Docker Hub.
    
* Downloads the image to your local system if itâ€™s not already available.
    

#### 2\. **Pushing Images to a Registry**

To share an image, you can push it to a registry. Steps to push an image:

1. **Log in to the Registry**:
    
    ```bash
    docker login
    ```
    
    Enter your credentials to authenticate with the registry (e.g., Docker Hub).
    
2. **Tag the Image**:  
    Docker images must be tagged with the registry name and repository before pushing. For example:
    
    ```bash
    docker tag my-app:1.0 username/my-app:1.0
    ```
    
3. **Push the Image**:
    
    ```bash
    docker push username/my-app:1.0
    ```
    
    This uploads the `username/my-app` image with the `1.0` tag to the registry.
    

#### 3\. **Listing Local Images**

To see the images available on your local system:

```bash
docker images
```

### Setting Up a Private Docker Registry

#### 1\. **Using Dockerâ€™s Open-Source Registry**

You can deploy a private Docker registry using Dockerâ€™s official `registry` image:

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name private-registry registry:2
```

This command:

* Starts a container with a private registry accessible at [`localhost:5000`](http://localhost:5000).
    

#### 2\. **Pushing Images to the Private Registry**

1. Tag the image with the private registry's address:
    
    ```bash
    docker tag my-app:1.0 localhost:5000/my-app:1.0
    ```
    
2. Push the image to the private registry:
    
    ```bash
    docker push localhost:5000/my-app:1.0
    ```
    

#### 3\. **Pulling Images from the Private Registry**

You can pull images from your private registry by specifying its address:

```bash
docker pull localhost:5000/my-app:1.0
```

### Using Docker Hub

#### 1\. **Creating a Repository on Docker Hub**

1. Go to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) and log in.
    
2. Create a new repository by clicking **Create Repository**.
    
3. Provide a name, description, and choose visibility (public or private).
    

#### 2\. **Pushing to Docker Hub**

Once the repository is created:

* Tag your image with your Docker Hub username and repository name:
    
    ```bash
    docker tag my-app:1.0 username/my-app:1.0
    ```
    
* Push the image to Docker Hub:
    
    ```bash
    docker push username/my-app:1.0
    ```

    [Azure ACR Documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/)
    

### Securing Docker Registries

1. **Authentication and Authorization**:  
    Ensure users authenticate before accessing the registry. Most registries support role-based access control (RBAC).
    
2. **TLS Encryption**:  
    Always use HTTPS to secure communication between clients and the registry.
    
3. **Image Scanning**:  
    Regularly scan images for vulnerabilities using tools like Dockerâ€™s built-in scanning feature or third-party solutions like Trivy or Clair.
    
4. **Access Logs and Auditing**:  
    Monitor registry access logs to detect unauthorized activities.
    

### Advantages of Docker Registries

* **Centralized Storage**: Easily manage and distribute Docker images.
    
* **Scalability**: Private registries can be scaled to meet enterprise needs.
    
* **Version Control**: Use tags to maintain different versions of images.
    
* **Portability**: Allows sharing images across environments, from development to production.
    

# Multi-Stage Docker Builds

**Multi-stage builds** in Docker are a way to optimize Docker images by using multiple `FROM` statements in one Dockerfile. This technique lets you use intermediate stages for building and testing, while making sure the final image only contains the essential runtime dependencies. This results in smaller and more efficient images.

### Why Use Multi-Stage Builds?

1. **Smaller Image Size**: Only the final stage is included in the output, omitting unnecessary tools and files used during the build process.
    
2. **Improved Security**: The production image doesn't contain build tools, source code, or sensitive information used during the build.
    
3. **Simpler Build Process**: Enables complex builds within a single Dockerfile without needing external scripts.
    
4. **Better Organization**: Each stage can focus on a specific part of the build pipeline, making it easier to manage.
    

### Basic Structure of Multi-Stage Builds

Hereâ€™s how multi-stage builds work in a Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build Stage
FROM node:16 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . ./
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Final Stage
FROM nginx:latest
COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
```

### Explanation

1. **Stage 1 (**`builder`):
    
    * Uses a Node.js image to build a React application.
        
    * Installs dependencies and builds the app in the `/app/build` directory.
        
2. **Stage 2 (final stage)**:
    
    * Uses an Nginx image to serve the React application.
        
    * Copies the output (`/app/build`) from the `builder` stage into Nginx's default static file directory.
        
    * The final image only contains the Nginx server and the application build files, significantly reducing size and complexity.
        

### Key Concepts in Multi-Stage Builds

1. **Named Stages**: Each stage can have a name (e.g., `AS builder`) to refer to it in later stages.
    
2. **Copying Between Stages**: Use the `COPY --from=<stage_name>` instruction to copy files or directories from a previous stage into the current stage.
    
3. **Multiple Stages**: You can define as many stages as needed, but only the final stage contributes to the final image.
    

### Advanced Example: Go Application

A multi-stage build for a Go application:

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build Stage
FROM golang:1.18 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . ./
RUN go mod tidy
RUN go build -o app .

# Stage 2: Final Stage
FROM alpine:latest
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/app .
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["./app"]
```

#### Explanation:

* **Stage 1 (Builder)**:
    
    * Builds the Go application.
        
    * Produces a binary called `app`.
        
* **Stage 2 (Final)**:
    
    * Uses a lightweight Alpine image.
        
    * Copies only the compiled binary from the builder stage.
        
    * Results in a minimal image suitable for production.
        

### Best Practices for Multi-Stage Builds

1. **Keep Stages Minimal**:
    
    * Use only the dependencies needed for each stage.
        
    * Remove unnecessary files to reduce intermediate image sizes.
        
2. **Use Lightweight Final Images**:
    
    * Choose minimal base images (e.g., `alpine`) for the final stage to minimize the attack surface and image size.
        
3. **Leverage Caching**:
    
    * Place instructions that change frequently (e.g., `COPY`) later in the Dockerfile to maximize cache utilization.
        
4. **Combine Build Steps**:
    
    * Chain commands in the same `RUN` statement where possible to reduce the number of image layers.
        

### Example: Python Application with Testing

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build and Test
FROM python:3.9 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . ./
RUN pytest

# Stage 2: Production
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app /app
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

#### Explanation:

* **Stage 1**:
    
    * Installs dependencies.
        
    * Runs tests using `pytest`.
        
* **Stage 2**:
    
    * Copies the application from the builder stage to a slim Python image for production.
        

### Benefits of Multi-Stage Builds

* **Cleaner Images**: No leftover build tools or unnecessary files in the final image.
    
* **Efficient Builds**: Combine build, test, and deployment steps in one Dockerfile.
    
* **Reusability**: Intermediate stages can be reused in different pipelines.
    
* **Modularization**: Separating concerns (e.g., building, testing, runtime) makes Dockerfiles easier to maintain.
    

# Monitoring and Logging in Docker

Monitoring and logging are crucial for maintaining and troubleshooting containerized applications in Docker. They give you insights into the performance, behavior, and issues of your containers and infrastructure. Docker provides built-in tools for logging and monitoring, and you can also integrate third-party solutions for more advanced features.

### Docker Logging

Docker has a built-in logging mechanism that captures standard output (`stdout`) and standard error (`stderr`) streams from containers. These logs can be viewed using Docker CLI commands or sent to external logging systems for analysis.

#### 1\. **Docker Logging Drivers**

Docker supports multiple logging drivers that determine how and where logs are stored. Some common logging drivers include:

| Logging Driver | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `json-file` | Default driver; stores logs as JSON files on the host. |
| `syslog` | Sends logs to the syslog server. |
| `journald` | Sends logs to `systemd`'s `journald`. |
| `gelf` | Sends logs to a Graylog Extended Log Format (GELF) server. |
| `fluentd` | Sends logs to Fluentd. |
| `awslogs` | Sends logs to AWS CloudWatch. |
| `splunk` | Sends logs to Splunk. |
| `none` | Disables logging for the container. |

You can specify the logging driver globally or per container.

##### Setting a Logging Driver Globally

Edit the Docker daemon configuration file (`/etc/docker/daemon.json`) to set a global logging driver:

```json
{
  "log-driver": "json-file",
  "log-opts": {
    "max-size": "10m",
    "max-file": "3"
  }
}
```

Restart the Docker daemon for the changes to take effect:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

##### Setting a Logging Driver Per Container

You can set a specific logging driver when running a container:

```bash
docker run --log-driver=json-file --log-opt max-size=10m --log-opt max-file=3 nginx
```

#### 2\. **Viewing Container Logs**

Use the `docker logs` command to view logs from a running or stopped container:

```bash
docker logs <container-id>
```

Additional options:

* **Follow logs in real-time**:
    
    ```bash
    docker logs -f <container-id>
    ```
    
* **Show a limited number of log lines**:
    
    ```bash
    docker logs --tail 100 <container-id>
    ```
    
* **View logs with timestamps**:
    
    ```bash
    docker logs --timestamps <container-id>
    ```
    

### Docker Monitoring

Monitoring Docker involves tracking the performance of containers, images, networks, and the Docker engine itself. Docker provides basic metrics, but for advanced monitoring, you can use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog.

#### 1\. **Docker Stats Command**

Docker provides a `stats` command to monitor container resource usage in real-time:

```bash
docker stats
```

Output includes:

* **CPU usage** (%)
    
* **Memory usage/limit**
    
* **Network I/O**
    
* **Block I/O**
    
* **PIDs**
    

To monitor specific containers:

```bash
docker stats <container-id1> <container-id2>
```

#### 2\. **Docker API for Monitoring**

Docker's REST API provides detailed metrics and state information about containers and the Docker engine. Example:

```bash
curl --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http://localhost/containers/json
```

#### 3\. **Third-Party Monitoring Tools**

For large-scale Docker deployments, consider these tools for enhanced monitoring:

* **Prometheus and Grafana**:
    
    * Prometheus scrapes metrics from Docker and visualizes them using Grafana.
        
    * Export metrics using cAdvisor, which is purpose-built for container monitoring.
        
* **Datadog**:
    
    * A cloud-based monitoring tool that provides real-time metrics, alerts, and dashboards for Docker containers.
        
    * Datadogâ€™s agent collects container metrics and integrates with orchestrators like Kubernetes.
        
* **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**:
    
    * Logstash collects and processes logs.
        
    * Elasticsearch indexes logs for querying.
        
    * Kibana visualizes logs and metrics.
        
* **Sysdig**:
    
    * Provides deep visibility into Docker containers.
        
    * Includes runtime security monitoring and troubleshooting features.
        

### Logging and Monitoring Best Practices

1. **Centralized Logging**:
    
    * Use a centralized logging solution like ELK, Fluentd, or Splunk to aggregate container logs across nodes.
        
2. **Log Rotation**:
    
    * Prevent log files from consuming excessive disk space by enabling log rotation using the `json-file` logging driver:
        
        ```bash
        docker run --log-opt max-size=10m --log-opt max-file=3 nginx
        ```
        
3. **Monitor Resource Utilization**:
    
    * Regularly monitor CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network usage to identify performance bottlenecks.
        
4. **Set Alerts**:
    
    * Configure alerts for anomalies like high resource utilization, container restarts, or crashes.
        
5. **Use Labels for Filtering**:
    
    * Add meaningful labels to containers for easier log filtering and monitoring.
        
    
    Example:
    
    ```bash
    docker run --label app=webserver nginx
    ```
    
6. **Secure Logs**:
    
    * Ensure logs donâ€™t expose sensitive information like passwords or tokens. Use tools like Vault to manage secrets.
        
7. **Automate Monitoring**:
    
    * Use orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes) with built-in monitoring capabilities to automate scaling and performance management.
        

### Example: Setting Up Centralized Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

1. **Install cAdvisor**: Run the `google/cadvisor` container to export Docker metrics:
    
    ```bash
    docker run -d \
      --name=cadvisor \
      --volume=/:/rootfs:ro \
      --volume=/var/run:/var/run:ro \
      --volume=/sys:/sys:ro \
      --volume=/var/lib/docker/:/var/lib/docker:ro \
      --publish=8080:8080 \
      gcr.io/cadvisor/cadvisor
    ```
    
2. **Run Prometheus**: Create a `prometheus.yml` configuration file to scrape metrics from cAdvisor:
    
    ```yaml
    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: 'cadvisor'
        static_configs:
          - targets: ['localhost:8080']
    ```
    
    Start Prometheus:
    
    ```bash
    docker run -d \
      --name=prometheus \
      -p 9090:9090 \
      -v $(pwd)/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
      prom/prometheus
    ```
    
3. **Run Grafana**: Run Grafana and configure it to use Prometheus as a data source:
    
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana
    ```
    
4. **Visualize Metrics**: Use Grafana dashboards to monitor your Docker containers.
    

# Orchestrating Docker with Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a powerful platform for managing containers that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. While Docker is used to build and run individual containers, Kubernetes lets you manage and organize multiple containers across a distributed system.

### Key Concepts in Kubernetes for Orchestrating Docker

1. **Cluster**:
    
    * A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of nodes (machines) that run containerized applications.
        
    * It includes a control plane (master node) for managing the cluster and worker nodes for running workloads.
        
2. **Node**:
    
    * A node is a physical or virtual machine in the cluster.
        
    * Each node runs a container runtime (e.g., Docker or containerd), a `kubelet` agent, and a networking component.
        
3. **Pod**:
    
    * A pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
        
    * It can contain one or more tightly coupled containers that share the same network namespace and storage.
        
4. **Deployment**:
    
    * A Kubernetes Deployment manages the desired state of pods, including scaling and updating containerized applications.
        
5. **Service**:
    
    * A Kubernetes Service exposes a set of pods as a network service, enabling communication between components.
        
6. **ConfigMap and Secrets**:
    
    * Used to manage configuration data and sensitive information like API keys or passwords.
        
7. **Ingress**:
    
    * Provides HTTP and HTTPS routing to services within the cluster.
        
8. **Namespace**:
    
    * Logical partitions within a cluster to separate resources and workloads.
        

### Benefits of Kubernetes for Docker Orchestration

1. **Scalability**:
    
    * Automatically scale applications up or down based on demand.
        
2. **Load Balancing**:
    
    * Distribute traffic across multiple pods to ensure reliability.
        
3. **Self-Healing**:
    
    * Automatically restarts failed containers, replaces unhealthy pods, and reschedules workloads.
        
4. **Declarative Configuration**:
    
    * Use YAML or JSON files to declare the desired state of the cluster.
        
5. **Rolling Updates and Rollbacks**:
    
    * Seamlessly deploy new versions of applications without downtime, with the ability to rollback if necessary.
        
6. **Multi-Cloud Support**:
    
    * Kubernetes runs on various cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) and on-premises environments.
        

### Setting Up Docker Containers in Kubernetes

#### 1\. **Install Kubernetes**

* Use a managed Kubernetes service (e.g., Google Kubernetes Engine, Amazon EKS, Azure AKS) for ease of use.
    
* Or install Kubernetes locally using:
    
    * **Minikube**: A local Kubernetes cluster.
        
    * **Kind**: Kubernetes in Docker.
        

#### 2\. **Containerize Your Application**

Ensure your application is packaged as a Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t my-app:1.0 .
docker push <your-repo>/my-app:1.0
```

### Kubernetes YAML Configuration

1. **Deployment**: Define how your application is deployed and managed in the cluster.
    

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app
        image: <your-repo>/my-app:1.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

* **Replicas**: Specifies the desired number of pods.
    
* **Image**: Docker image to deploy.
    

2. **Service**: Exposes your application to enable communication within or outside the cluster.
    

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
```

* **Selector**: Matches pods with the label `app: my-app`.
    
* **Type**: Can be `ClusterIP`, `NodePort`, or `LoadBalancer`.
    

### Deploying Applications on Kubernetes

1. **Apply Configuration**: Use the `kubectl` command to create resources from your YAML files:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f service.yaml
    ```
    
2. **Check the Status**: Verify the resources are created and running:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl get deployments
    kubectl get pods
    kubectl get services
    ```
    
3. **Access the Application**:
    
    * If using a `LoadBalancer` service, note the external IP address.
        
    * For `NodePort`, access via `<node-ip>:<node-port>`.
        

### Advanced Kubernetes Features for Docker

1. **Scaling**: Scale up or down based on demand:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl scale deployment my-app-deployment --replicas=5
    ```
    
2. **Auto-Scaling**: Enable horizontal pod autoscaling based on CPU or memory usage:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl autoscale deployment my-app-deployment --min=2 --max=10 --cpu-percent=80
    ```
    
3. **Rolling Updates**: Deploy new versions of your application without downtime:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl set image deployment/my-app-deployment my-app=<your-repo>/my-app:2.0
    ```
    
4. **Persistent Storage**: Use Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) for stateful applications.
    
5. **Monitoring**:
    
    * Use Kubernetes-native tools like Metrics Server.
        
    * Integrate with Prometheus, Grafana, or other third-party tools.
        

### Kubernetes Ecosystem Tools

1. **Helm**:
    
    * Package manager for Kubernetes.
        
    * Simplifies deployment and management with reusable charts.
        
2. **Istio**:
    
    * Service mesh for managing service-to-service communication, including traffic routing and security.
        
3. **Kustomize**:
    
    * Tool for customizing Kubernetes configurations without modifying the original YAML files.
        
4. **kubectl**:
    
    * Command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.
