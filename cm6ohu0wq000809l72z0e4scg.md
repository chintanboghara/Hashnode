In the constantly changing world of artificial intelligence, OpenAI has made another big advancement with the launch of OpenAI o3-mini. This new model aims to enhance cost-effective reasoning, providing excellent STEM capabilities while keeping costs low and reducing delays. Starting today, OpenAI o3-mini is available in ChatGPT and the API, and it is expected to transform AI-powered problem-solving in many areas.

## Smarter, Faster, and More Efficient

OpenAI o3-mini improves on its earlier models by making significant progress in science, math, and coding. Compared to OpenAI o1-mini, this model offers faster responses and greater accuracy while maintaining low operational costs.

One of the most exciting features of OpenAI o3-mini is its ability to adjust reasoning effort based on task complexity. Developers can select from three reasoning levels—low, medium, and high—to tailor performance to their specific needs. Whether focusing on speed or in-depth problem-solving, the o3-mini is designed for flexibility.

## Production-Ready with Enhanced Developer Features

For the first time, a small reasoning model from OpenAI includes highly requested developer features, such as:

* **Function Calling**
    
* **Structured Outputs**
    
* **Developer Messages**
    
* **Streaming Capabilities**
    

These features make OpenAI o3-mini production-ready from day one, empowering developers with greater flexibility in integrating AI into their applications.

## Powerful STEM Performance

OpenAI o3-mini has been rigorously tested across multiple domains, demonstrating its superiority in STEM-related tasks. Some key benchmarks include:

* **Mathematics:** Matches OpenAI o1's performance in math at medium reasoning effort and surpasses it at high reasoning effort.
    
* **PhD-Level Science Questions (GPQA Diamond):** Achieves 77% accuracy at high reasoning effort, outperforming earlier models.
    
* **Competition Coding (Codeforces):** Reaches an Elo rating of 2073 at high reasoning effort, showing substantial progress in competitive programming.
    
* **Software Engineering (SWE-bench Verified):** Records the highest accuracy among released OpenAI models, reaching 48.9%.
    
* **LiveBench Coding:** Even at medium reasoning effort, OpenAI o3-mini surpasses OpenAI o1-high, demonstrating efficiency in real-world coding tasks.
    

These achievements make OpenAI o3-mini an ideal choice for developers and researchers who rely on AI for complex problem-solving in technical fields.

## Accessible to More Users

With this release, OpenAI is also expanding access to its reasoning models. OpenAI o3-mini is now available to:

* **ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users** (starting today)
    
* **Enterprise users** (coming in February)
    
* **Free plan users** (by selecting 'Reason' in the message composer or regenerating a response)

Additionally, OpenAI is tripling the message limit for Plus and Team users from 50 messages per day (with o1-mini) to 150 messages per day (with o3-mini). Pro users will have unlimited access to both o3-mini and o3-mini-high.

## Faster and More Reliable Performance

OpenAI o3-mini not only boosts reasoning but also greatly improves response speed. With an average response time of 7.7 seconds—24% faster than OpenAI o1-mini—it ensures users get answers more quickly. It also features an average **2,500ms faster time to first token**, reducing delays and making interactions smoother.

## Prioritizing Safety and Alignment

A key focus of OpenAI o3-mini is maintaining high safety standards. Leveraging deliberative alignment techniques, the model has been trained to reason about human-written safety specifications before generating responses. Evaluations indicate that OpenAI o3-mini significantly surpasses GPT-4o on challenging safety and jailbreak tests, ensuring robust and secure AI interactions.

## What’s Next for OpenAI o3-mini?

The launch of OpenAI o3-mini is another step forward in OpenAI’s mission to democratize access to powerful AI at a lower cost. By making high-quality reasoning models more affordable and efficient, OpenAI is driving the future of AI adoption.

With continued advancements in reasoning, efficiency, and safety, OpenAI remains committed to pushing the boundaries of AI development. Stay tuned for further innovations as OpenAI refines and expands its intelligent reasoning models.
