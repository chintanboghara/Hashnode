## **Overview**

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. It supports both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large and rapidly growing ecosystem, with many services, support options, and tools widely available.

## **Why You Need Kubernetes and What It Can Do**

Containers are a great way to package and run your applications. In a production environment, you need to manage these containers to ensure there is no downtime. For instance, if one container fails, another should start automatically. Wouldn't it be easier if a system handled this for you?

That's where Kubernetes comes in! Kubernetes offers a framework to run distributed systems reliably. It handles scaling and failover for your applications, provides deployment patterns, and more. For example, Kubernetes can easily manage a canary deployment for your system.

### **Kubernetes offers you:**

* **Service discovery and load balancing**: Kubernetes can expose a container using a DNS name or its own IP address. If a container receives high traffic, Kubernetes can load balance and distribute the network traffic to keep the deployment stable.
    
* **Storage orchestration**: Kubernetes allows you to automatically mount a storage system of your choice, such as local storage, public cloud providers, and more.
    
* **Automated rollouts and rollbacks**: With Kubernetes, you can set the desired state for your deployed containers, and it will adjust the actual state to match this desired state at a controlled speed. For instance, Kubernetes can automatically create new containers for your deployment, remove old ones, and shift all resources to the new container.
    
* **Automatic bin packing**: You provide Kubernetes with a cluster of nodes to run containerized tasks. You specify how much CPU and memory (RAM) each container requires. Kubernetes then places containers on your nodes to optimize resource usage.
    
* **Self-healing**: Kubernetes restarts containers that fail, replaces them, kills containers that don't respond to your health checks, and doesn't make them available to clients until they are ready to serve.
    
* **Secret and configuration management**: Kubernetes allows you to store and manage sensitive information like passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys. You can deploy and update secrets and application configurations without rebuilding your container images or exposing secrets in your stack configuration.
    
* **Batch execution**: Besides managing services, Kubernetes can handle your batch and CI workloads, and it can replace failed containers if needed.
    
* **Horizontal scaling**: Easily scale your application up or down with a simple command, through a UI, or automatically based on CPU usage.
    
* **IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack**: Allocate both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to Pods and Services.
    
* **Designed for extensibility**: Add features to your Kubernetes cluster without altering the original source code.
    

## **What Kubernetes Is Not**

Kubernetes is not a traditional, all-in-one PaaS (Platform as a Service) system. It works at the container level, not the hardware level, and offers features like deployment, scaling, and load balancing, similar to PaaS. It also allows users to add their own logging, monitoring, and alerting tools. However, Kubernetes is not a single, fixed solution. Its default options are optional and can be customized. Kubernetes provides the tools to create developer platforms while maintaining user choice and flexibility where it matters.

### **Kubernetes:**

* Does not limit the types of applications it supports. Kubernetes is designed to handle a wide range of workloads, including stateless, stateful, and data-processing tasks. If an application can run in a container, it should work well on Kubernetes.
    
* Does not deploy source code or build your application. Continuous Integration, Delivery, and Deployment (CI/CD) workflows depend on organizational culture, preferences, and technical needs.
    
* Does not provide application-level services, such as middleware (e.g., message buses), data-processing frameworks (e.g., Spark), databases (e.g., MySQL), caches, or cluster storage systems (e.g., Ceph) as built-in services. These components can run on Kubernetes or be accessed by applications running on Kubernetes through portable methods, like the [Open Service Broker](https://openservicebrokerapi.org/).
    
* Does not dictate logging, monitoring, or alerting solutions. It offers some integrations as examples and provides tools to collect and export metrics.
    
* Does not provide or require a specific configuration language or system (like Jsonnet). It offers a declarative API that can be used with various forms of declarative specifications.
    
* Does not include or enforce any comprehensive machine configuration, maintenance, management, or self-healing systems.
    
* Additionally, Kubernetes is not just an orchestration system. In fact, it removes the need for orchestration. Orchestration typically means executing a set workflow: first do A, then B, then C. Instead, Kubernetes consists of independent, composable control processes that continuously adjust the current state to match the desired state. It doesn't matter how you get from A to C, and centralized control isn't needed. This approach makes the system easier to use and more powerful, robust, resilient, and flexible.
    

## **Historical Context for Kubernetes**

[![Deployment evolution](https://kubernetes.io/images/docs/Container_Evolution.svg align="left")](https://kubernetes.io/images/docs/Container_Evolution.svg)

### **Traditional Deployment Era:**

In the early days, organizations ran applications on physical servers. There was no way to set resource limits for applications on a physical server, leading to resource allocation problems. For instance, if multiple applications ran on one server, one application might use most of the resources, causing the others to perform poorly. A solution was to run each application on a separate physical server. However, this approach didn't scale well because resources were underused, and it was costly for organizations to maintain many physical servers.

### **Virtualized Deployment Era:**

To address these issues, virtualization was introduced. It lets you run multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) on a single physical server's CPU. Virtualization keeps applications separate in different VMs and adds a layer of security, as one application's data can't be accessed by another.

Virtualization improves resource use on a physical server and enhances scalability because you can easily add or update applications. It also lowers hardware costs. With virtualization, you can present a set of physical resources as a cluster of flexible virtual machines.

Each VM operates as a complete machine, running all necessary components, including its own operating system, on top of the virtualized hardware.

### **Container Deployment Era:**

Containers are like VMs, but they have less strict isolation, allowing them to share the Operating System (OS) among applications. This makes containers lightweight. Like a VM, a container has its own filesystem, share of CPU, memory, process space, and more. Since they are separate from the underlying infrastructure, they can be easily moved across different clouds and OS distributions.

**Containers have become popular because they offer several benefits, such as:**

* Agile application creation and deployment: It's easier and more efficient to create container images compared to VM images.
    
* Continuous development, integration, and deployment: Allows for reliable and frequent building and deploying of container images with quick rollbacks due to image immutability.
    
* Separation of concerns for Dev and Ops: Application container images are created at build/release time, not at deployment time, separating applications from infrastructure.
    
* Observability: Provides OS-level information and metrics, as well as application health and other signals.
    
* Consistent environment across development, testing, and production: Runs the same on a laptop as it does in the cloud.
    
* Portability across clouds and OS distributions: Runs on Ubuntu, RHEL, CoreOS, on-premises, on major public clouds, and anywhere else.
    
* Application-centric management: Shifts the focus from running an OS on virtual hardware to running an application on an OS using logical resources.
    
* Loosely coupled, distributed, elastic, and flexible microservices: Applications are divided into smaller, independent parts that can be deployed and managed dynamically, rather than as a single large stack on one machine.
    
* Resource isolation: Ensures predictable application performance.
    
* Resource utilization: Offers high efficiency and density.
