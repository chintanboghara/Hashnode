When managing infrastructure with Terraform, handling sensitive information securely is critical. Credentials like database passwords, API keys, and private keys must be protected to prevent accidental exposure. Terraform provides multiple mechanisms to safeguard sensitive input variables, ensuring that these secrets do not appear in logs, output, or version control. In this blog post, weâ€™ll explore several best practices and techniques for protecting sensitive input variables in Terraform.

## 1\. Marking Variables as Sensitive

Terraform allows you to mark input variables as **sensitive** so that their values are not displayed in the command-line output or logs. This is done by setting the `sensitive` attribute to `true` when declaring a variable.

### Defining a Sensitive Variable

Create a variable in your configuration file (e.g., [`variables.tf`](http://variables.tf)) and mark it as sensitive:

```plaintext
variable "db_password" {
  description = "The database password"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
}
```

### Using Sensitive Variables in Outputs

Even when outputting sensitive data, Terraform can mask these values:

```plaintext
output "database_password" {
  value     = var.db_password
  sensitive = true
}
```

When you run:

```bash
terraform output
```

The output will be masked:

```plaintext
database_password = <sensitive>
```

> **Note:** While marking a variable as `sensitive` prevents it from being printed in outputs and logs, **it does not prevent the value from being stored in the Terraform state file**. Additional measures are needed to secure the state file.

## 2\. Passing Sensitive Variables Securely

### a) Using Environment Variables

One of the safest methods to provide sensitive values is through environment variables. Terraform will automatically use environment variables prefixed with `TF_VAR_` to assign values to corresponding variables.

#### Example

For a variable named `db_password`:

```bash
export TF_VAR_db_password="my-secure-password"
terraform apply
```

This approach ensures that sensitive values are not hardcoded in your configuration or `.tfvars` files.

### b) Using a `.tfvars` File (And Excluding It from Version Control)

You can also store sensitive data in a separate `.tfvars` file, such as `secrets.tfvars`, and make sure this file is excluded from your version control system.

#### Example: `secrets.tfvars`

```plaintext
db_password = "supersecret123"
```

Run Terraform with the variable file:

```bash
terraform apply -var-file="secrets.tfvars"
```

#### Secure Your `.tfvars` Files

Add these files to your `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits:

```plaintext
# Ignore variable files containing secrets
*.tfvars
```

> **Warning:** If you commit a `.tfvars` file containing sensitive information, immediately rotate those credentials.

### c) Integrating with Secret Managers

For enhanced security, retrieve sensitive data directly from a secure vault like AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or Azure Key Vault. This approach eliminates the need to store secrets in your Terraform code.

#### Example: Using AWS Secrets Manager

```plaintext
data "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "db_password" {
  secret_id = "my-db-password"
}

variable "db_password" {
  description = "The database password"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
  default     = data.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.db_password.secret_string
}
```

By fetching secrets at runtime, you keep sensitive information out of your configuration files entirely.

## 3\. Encrypting the Terraform State File

Even if you mark variables as sensitive, their values are still stored in the Terraform state file (`terraform.tfstate`). Securing this file is vital to protect sensitive data.

### a) Use an Encrypted Remote Backend

Storing your state file remotely in a secure, encrypted backend can significantly reduce the risk of exposing sensitive data.

#### Example: AWS S3 with Encryption

```plaintext
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
    key            = "terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    encrypt        = true
    kms_key_id     = "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/my-kms-key"
  }
}
```

This configuration ensures that the state file is encrypted at rest using AWS KMS.

### b) Restrict Access to the State File

* **Limit access:** Only authorized users should have access to the remote backend.
    
* **Enable auditing and logging:** Monitor who accesses your state file for added security.
    

## 4\. Best Practices for Handling Sensitive Variables

* **Always use** `sensitive = true`: Prevent secrets from being printed in logs or outputs.
    
* **Prefer environment variables:** Set sensitive values using environment variables (`TF_VAR_`) instead of hardcoding them.
    
* **Store secrets outside of version control:** Use `.tfvars` files for sensitive data, but ensure they are excluded from Git.
    
* **Leverage secret managers:** Integrate with AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or similar services to fetch secrets at runtime.
    
* **Encrypt and secure the state file:** Use encrypted backends and restrict access to your Terraform state.
    

## Conclusion

Protecting sensitive input variables in Terraform is a crucial aspect of infrastructure security. By marking variables as sensitive, securely passing values through environment variables or secret managers, and encrypting your state file, you can significantly reduce the risk of exposing critical data.

Implement these best practices to keep your secrets safe and maintain a secure Terraform environment. Happy, secure Terraforming!
