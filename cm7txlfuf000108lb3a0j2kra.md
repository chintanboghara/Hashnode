Imagine a world where your computer listens to your commands and automatically navigates the web—searching, clicking, and even filling out forms—all powered by AI. With **Browser Use**, that world is here. This innovative tool empowers you to connect AI agents directly with your browser, simplifying web automation and opening up a realm of creative possibilities.

## What Is Browser Use?

**Browser Use** is a powerful, easy-to-use library that bridges the gap between AI agents and web browsers. Whether you’re automating tedious tasks, building sophisticated web bots, or just exploring the potential of AI-driven browsing, Browser Use has you covered. It’s designed to be accessible to developers of all levels, enabling you to deploy advanced automation with minimal setup.

### Key Features

* **Seamless Integration:** Connect your AI agents with your browser effortlessly.
    
* **Quick Start:** Get up and running in minutes with simple installation and configuration.
    
* **Hosted and Local Options:** Choose between a cloud-hosted version or setting up your own environment.
    
* **Modular and Extensible:** Easily integrate with other tools and services to expand your automation capabilities.
    

## Getting Started: Quick Start Guide

Browser Use is built for simplicity. With Python (version 3.11 or higher), you can install the library and its dependencies in just a few steps.

### Installation

First, install the package via pip:

```bash
pip install browser-use
```

Next, install Playwright, which is used to drive browser automation:

```bash
playwright install
```

### Spinning Up Your AI Agent

Here’s a sample script to get you started. This example uses the GPT-4 OpenAI model via LangChain and demonstrates how to instruct your agent to search Reddit and return a comment from the first post.

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from browser_use import Agent
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        task="Go to Reddit, search for 'browser-use', click on the first post and return the first comment.",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o"),
    )
    result = await agent.run()
    print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```

Make sure to add your API keys (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`) to your `.env` file. For more settings, models, and detailed guidance, check out the [https://docs.browser-use.com](https://docs.browser-use.com/)

* **Advanced Planning:** Incorporate website-specific context to enhance decision-making.
    
* **Token Optimization:** Reduce token consumption through refined prompts and better DOM state management.
    

### DOM Extraction Improvements

* Enhance extraction for interactive elements like datepickers and dropdowns.
    
* Refine state representation for a more accurate understanding of UI components.
    

### Workflow Automation & Rerunning Tasks

* Integrate fallback mechanisms with LLMs.
    
* Simplify the creation of workflow templates where the AI fills in the details.
    
* Provide the option to generate executable Playwright scripts from agent commands.
    

### Dataset Creation & Model Benchmarking

* Build datasets for complex tasks.
    
* Benchmark various models and fine-tune them for specific use cases.
    

### User Experience

* Introduce human-in-the-loop execution.
    
* Improve the quality of generated GIFs for visual feedback.
    
* Develop demos for various applications such as job applications, social media tasks, and QA testing.
